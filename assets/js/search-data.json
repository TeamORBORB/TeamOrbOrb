Unit 3 Section 8.1 - Taiyo Iwazaki . Lesson Objectives: . Express an algorithm that uses iteration without using a programming language | Define an iteration | The Basics Of Iteration | LESSON Vocab: . Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . . Lets say you are looking for a lost item inside of your house... What steps would you take? . Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 3): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met. | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(11): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .
